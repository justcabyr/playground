## Problems

### Organization Problems
- Structure responsibilities in groups and not individuals to allow for onboarding ease.


### Developer Problems
- Source Control
    - Repository and Branch Management (Lock down the main branch)

- Service Management
    - Empower developers to manage their own services, configurations and provisioning.
    - Save quality DevOps engineering time.

- Continuous Integration
    - Testing changes (cloud/local testing)
    - Caching branches
    - Burning Cloud money
    - Code coverage (write tests and coverage for everything)
